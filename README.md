This is an initial prototype for redesigning Peer Grading and general Open Ended Submission Evaluation.

Installation
------------

./manage.py runserver

The intent of this prototype is to be installed as a plugin for the edx-platform. Refer to XBlock and
XModule documentation for more details. (Though I should have more here once this prototype is better
refined...)
