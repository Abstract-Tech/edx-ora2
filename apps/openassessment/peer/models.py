    """A Rubric contains the guidelines on how to assess a submission.

    Rubrics are composed of :class:`Criterion` objects which are in turn
    composed of :class:`CriterionOption` objects.

    This model is a bit unusual in that it is the representation of the rubric
    that an assessment was made with *at the time of assessment*. The source
    rubric data lives in the problem definition, which is in the
    :class:`OpenAssessmentBlock`. When an assessment is made, the XBlock passes
    that rubric information along as well. When this Django app records the
    :class:`Assessment`, we do a lookup to see if the Rubric model object
    already exists (using hashing). If the Rubric is not found, we create a new
    one with the information OpenAssessmentBlock has passed in.

    .. warning::
       Never change Rubric model data after it's written!

    The little tree of objects that compose a Rubric is meant to be immutable â€”
    once created, they're never updated. When the problem changes, we end up
    creating a new Rubric instead. This makes it easy to cache and do hash-based
    lookups.
