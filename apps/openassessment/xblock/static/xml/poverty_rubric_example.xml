            Global Poverty
        </title>
        <prompt>
            Given the state of the world today, what do you think should be done to
            combat poverty?
        </prompt>
        <rubric>
            Read for conciseness, clarity of thought, and form.
            <criterion name="concise">
                How concise is it?
                <option val="0">(0) Neal Stephenson (late)
                    <explain>
                        In "Cryptonomicon", Stephenson spent multiple pages talking about breakfast cereal.
                        While hilarious, in recent years his work has been anything but 'concise'.

                <option val="1">(1) HP Lovecraft
                    <explain>
                        If the author wrote something cyclopean that staggers the mind, score it thus.

                <option val="3">(3) Robert Heinlein
                    <explain>
                        Tight prose that conveys a wealth of information about the world in relatively
                        few words. Example, "The door irised open and he stepped inside."

                <option val="4">(4) Neal Stephenson (early)
                    <explain>
                        When Stephenson still had an editor, his prose was dense, with anecdotes about
                        nitrox abuse implying main characters' whole life stories.
                    </explain>
                </option>
                <option val="5">(5) Earnest Hemingway
                    <explain>
                        Score the work this way if it makes you weep, and the removal of a single
                        word would make you sneer.

                    <explain>
                        Coolly rational, with a firm grasp of the main topics, a crystal-clear train of thought,
                        and unemotional examination of the facts.  This is the only item explained in this category,
                        to show that explained and unexplained items can be mixed.

                Lastly, how is it's form? Punctuation, grammar, and spelling all count.
